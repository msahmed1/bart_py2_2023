      <p>Thank you for agreeing to take part in this study.</p>
      <p>
        Your aim in this study is to win points by pumping the balloon up. You
        may pump the balloon up as many times as you wish by pressing the
        'Inflate' button. Each pump will give you 10 points, but it also
        increases the risk of the balloon bursting; the speed at which you pump
        the balloon does not affect the likelihood of the balloon bursting.
        Strategise wisely and aim to collect as many points as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you burst the balloon, you will lose all the points
        collected from that balloon.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can stop pumping the balloon up at any point and collect your earned
        points by pressing the 'Collect' button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The robot on your right was programmed to watch and learn when you
        decide to inflate the balloon and when you decide to collect the points.
        Later in this study, the robot will use what it has learned to provide
        you with suggestions on whether or not to inflate the balloon based on
        your play style.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this study, you will complete 2 blocks, each with 30 balloon trials.
